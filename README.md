## Description

Feedback Master is an app that helps us students provide the information to Prime Academy on how they're doing as an educational institution and how they're working us, the students.

What problem did you solve? 
They needed to know how we were doing! So this app lets students leave 4 kinds of feedback that grades Prrime and it's instructors how we think they're doing at providing us our education.

How did you solve it?
4 input fields allow users(students) to leave feedback info. This data is then showed to them during a review phase before they submit it. After submission the app prompts users to return to the start if they wish to leave more feedback.
